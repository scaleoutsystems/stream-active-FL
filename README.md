# stream-active-FL

This repository contains experimental code for a master thesis investigating client-side filtering strategies for continuous learning from streaming perception data in a federated setting. The core idea is to decide—for each incoming stream item—whether to train, store for replay, or skip, based on model-driven selection criteria.
