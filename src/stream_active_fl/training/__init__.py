"""
Training abstractions and loops.

Reusable training logic for different learning paradigms:
- Offline: Epoch-based training with batch sampling
- Streaming: Online training from temporal data streams
- Federated: Distributed training with periodic aggregation (future)
"""

# Future: Will contain offline.py, streaming.py, federated.py
# For now, training loops are in experiment scripts
